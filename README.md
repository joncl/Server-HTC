# Server-HTC
Humidity and Temperature Controller for server closet.

This is a Humidity and Temperature Controller designed to run on a ESP32 to control the temperature and humidity inside a sealed server closet. The closet is vented by one intake and one exhaust duct. A large HVAC filter is installed at the intake duct to maintain a dust-free environment. A variable RPM server-grade fan is installed at the exhaust duct inside server closet, which creates a pressure gradient and keeps air moving in and out of the closet. Outside the closet, at each intake and exhaust duct, there are two duct actuators (four in total). The Server-HTC sends signals to a relay which controls the open and close state of each duct actuator. There are also numerous sensors in the system to read temperature and humidity information from all intake and exhaust points of the system. The Server-HTC contuously monitors sensor information to determine by an algorithm the open and close state of each duct to maintain humidity and temperatures below set values depending on external conditions.
